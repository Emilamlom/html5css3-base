# My Base Skeleton for Web Design Projects (Change this)

Saves me time and get me up and running on a client project quickly. Designed to be cloned and renamed, but repositories stay local to my computer and don't get pushed to github (since I don't have an account with private repos).

This will be accompanied by a script in PowerShell that I want to build which will allow me to start all programs I need to start working (Sublime, Chrome with a Grooveshark tab, explorer windows with specific folders open, and the git shell). I hope to implement a directory listing feature that will allow me to select which project I am working on at the moment and open everything pertinent to that project.

## To-Do

 * Clean up index.html with just the information necessary for each project
 * Add in default styles and standard media query breakpoints that are generalized for each project
 * Go ahead and add in some basic components such as nav->ul->li header, article, and footer stuff.

Use it, change it, do what you want. It's just a personal project for me.
